# Adidas-Main-Carousel-Product-Specs

## Overview
My team and I created a full-stack web replica of Adidas's product page composed of three different microservices linked together through a proxy server. This portion of the application features the main product page, image zoom, product carousels, dynamic product modals, and a responsive navigation bar.
